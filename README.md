Water Supply Forecast competition model

## How to use this repository

This repository contains code both for preparing visualisations and for training and applying predictive models.

It is recommended to start exploration with [examples](./examples) folder:

- [1_basic](./examples/1_basic) - basic scripts that prepare exploratory data visualisations
- [2_repeating](./examples/2_repeating) - repeating of last known values to generate forecasts (in two versions)
- [3_streamflow](./examples/3_streamflow) - use of aggregated statistics from USGS streamflow data 


During code execution the `plots` folder is generated. 

For example, there you can find zones for which forecast models are initialized:
